# GODOT BLIT SPRITE 2D 
### a shit ass gd script that helps me make more fnf !!!



**Have you ever been using a sprite 2D in godot and you have region rect turned on and a shader applied and it messes up?**
_No?_ aw man that was my whole selling point :(

either way this solves the problem for me of having to modify every shader to consider region rects, whilst also taking into account json loading, positioning and all that shiz
**just download the entire project or Blit_Sprite.gd if you too want to make some wacky fnf stuff**
